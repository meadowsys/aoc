my [Advent of Code] solutions

## run configuration

There are environment variables that can be configured while running these solutions

- `NO_DEBUG_DATA`: disables using debug data. For every solution, the input is to be stored at `y{yyyy}-d{dd}.txt`, and a secondary "debug" input can be stored at `y{yyyy}-d{dd}.debug.txt`, which can be useful for doing things like putting the example input in, to check the input against a known answer.
